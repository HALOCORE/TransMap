### Python
def f_gold(arr, n):   # --- py stmt 1

  diff = 10 ** 20   # --- py stmt 3
  for i in range(n - 1):   # --- py stmt 4
    if arr[i + 1] - arr[i] < diff: diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]   # --- py stmt 5
  return diff   # --- py stmt 6


### JavaScript
"use strict";
const f_gold = (arr, n) => {   // --- py stmt 1

    if (arr[i + 1] - arr[i] < diff) diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i];   // --- py stmt 5
  }
