# TransMap Installation

## Hardware Requirements

This artifact requires a machine with at least 8GB of RAM, 4 CPU cores and basic graphics support (for browser). 

**NOTE:** Better CPUs (such as 9th gen core i5 or later) are preferred for faster execution and avoiding some rare concurrency issues observed on slower machines. 

## Software Requirements

### Option 1: Use Virtual Machine (suggested)
To simplify the artifact evaluation, we provide a **x86-64 virtual box VM** at this [link](https://XXX). If you use the VM, you don't need to install anything. All the necessary data, dependencies and tools are included.

### Option 2: Build from Source
This artifact requires Linux operating system with Docker 20.10, Python 3.8+ (with pip), and a chrome browser. The suggested editor is VSCode.
