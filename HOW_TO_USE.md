## Use TransMap on Your Own Python Program

To apply TransMap to your own Python program, you need to prepare the following files:

- `source.py`: The Python program to be translated.
- `source_test.py`: The Python test program for `source.py`. Alternatively, you can also put the tests in `source.py`. See below for details.
- `target_tmpl.js`: The JavaScript program template used for generating the translation `target.js`.
- `target_test.py`: The JavaScript test program for `target.js`. Alternatively, you can also put the tests in `target_tmpl.js`. See below for details.
