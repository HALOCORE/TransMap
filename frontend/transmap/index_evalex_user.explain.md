### What are you expected to do for the user study?

You are expected to use `vscode` (provided online version) to locate mistakes in the code and fix it so that it can passes the tests.   
To simplify the task, there will be only one hidden semantic mistake in the code.   
For details, please refer to the [User Study Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zvoQ2daM8T_k-ab55e4EgOSqiC9DP-A1mequEn0ge3w/edit?usp=sharing).   

**NOTE:** Please do record the time taken for each task:  
- How long does it take you to locate the mistake?
<!-- - How long does it take you to understand the the mistake? -->
- How long does it take you to fix the mistake?

You can use the `Mark Current Time` buttons above and compute the duration later.
